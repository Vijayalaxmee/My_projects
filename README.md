Problem Statement: Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis
Health is wealth. During the pandemic, we realized the brute effects of COVID-19 on everyone, regardless of status. This project aims to analyze heart disease data to prepare better for future health crises.

Project Requirements:

*ETL Process:
Extract data from the heart disease diagnostic dataset.
Clean the data, handle missing values, and transform it for analysis.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze heart disease rates by gender and by age.
Compare attributes such as cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and other medical indicators to find key insights.
Investigate correlations between various attributes to discover relationships that can help predict heart disease.

*Dashboard Creation:
Build a dashboard to visualize the key findings.

*The dashboard should include:
Heart disease rates by gender and age.
A correlation heatmap for numeric attributes to showcase meaningful relationships.
Key Metrics and Relationships:
Identify the most important metrics and risk factors from the dataset.
Show meaningful relationships between attributes, such as the correlation between age, cholesterol levels, and heart disease incidence.
