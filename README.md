**Problem Statement: Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis**
*Health is wealth. During the pandemic, we realized the brute effects of COVID-19 on everyone, regardless of status. This project aims to analyze heart disease data to prepare better for future health crises.

Project Requirements:

*ETL Process:
Extract data from the heart disease diagnostic dataset.
Clean the data, handle missing values, and transform it for analysis.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze heart disease rates by gender and by age.
Compare attributes such as cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and other medical indicators to find key insights.
Investigate correlations between various attributes to discover relationships that can help predict heart disease.

*Dashboard Creation:
Build a dashboard to visualize the key findings.

*The dashboard should include:
Heart disease rates by gender and age.
A correlation heatmap for numeric attributes to showcase meaningful relationships.
Key Metrics and Relationships:
Identify the most important metrics and risk factors from the dataset.
Show meaningful relationships between attributes, such as the correlation between age, cholesterol levels, and heart disease incidence.


**Problem Statement:Google play store App**
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between app installs, ratings, and other key factors for Google Play Store applications. Through the cleaning and transformation of raw data, I aim to draw insights regarding the behavior of apps in terms of their installs, size, price, and user ratings. Additionally, visualizations will help understand these relationships across different app categories.


*Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
I have successfully cleaned and preprocessed the key columns such as Price, Installs, Size, and Rating to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Non-numeric values in the Price column (like $) and in Installs (such as +, ,) were removed, and data types were converted to numeric formats.
I handled varying size units in the Size column by converting values to a standard format and addressed missing or incorrect values.

*Handling Missing Data:
I detected and handled missing values across Price, Installs, Size, and Rating. NaN values were filled appropriately (with 0 for numeric columns where applicable).
Ensured that all critical columns were ready for analysis by resolving missing or inconsistent entries.

*Visualization:
A scatter plot was created to show the relationship between Installs and Rating, using Category as a hue to distinguish between app types. This visualization, using a log scale for the number of installs, helps understand how different app categories perform in terms of user ratings.

**Problem Statement:Big data census gane analytics**
In this project, I analyzed the Big Game Census data to explore the geographical origins and related population figures of players from Super Bowl 52. The dataset, which combines Yahoo Sports roster information and census.gov population data, was used to uncover fun facts, trends, and insights about where these players were born and how those birthplaces correspond to state population data.


*Geographical Distribution of Players:
Analyzed and visualized the distribution of player birthplaces using geographical data.
Identified the top states contributing the most players to Super Bowl 52.

*Comparison with State Population Data:
Merged player birth state data with state population data from the 2017 census to compare the number of players each state produced relative to its population.
Uncovered states that were over- or under-represented in terms of player production, despite their population size.

*Visualizations:
Created several visualizations including bar charts and scatter plots to illustrate the number of players from each state and how this compares to the population.
Produced a geographical map showing the birthplaces of players to provide a more intuitive understanding of player distribution across the United States.

*Insights and Fun Facts:
Discovered interesting trends, such as certain smaller states producing a disproportionately high number of players relative to their population size.
Highlighted these fun facts in the visualizations, offering a deeper understanding of how demographics might play a role in player representation.

*Conclusions:
Concluded by summarizing the relationship between player birthplaces, population, and team composition, and considered how this data might sway audience rooting interests in the game.
